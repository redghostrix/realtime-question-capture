# Problem with Base faster-whisper model from HF

```sh
RuntimeError: Unsupported model binary version. This executable supports models with binary version v6 or below, but the model has binary version v1936876918. This usually means that the model was generated by a later version of CTranslate2. (Forward compatibility is not guaranteed.)
```

**Solution To figure this out**

- Run following command: 

```sh
ct2-transformers-converter --model openai/whisper-base --output_dir faster-whisper-base \
    --copy_files tokenizer.json --quantization float16
```
